# Discord.py-image-manipultaion
Small image manipulation command done with cv2
 Just a fun little project i decided to do with discord.py everythin is written in cv2 docs except reading the image done with prior knowledge from urllib

would probably have to redo this with aiohttp cause Discord.py is based on asyncio and async functions work best in async environment


Adding a new Feature tomorrow
